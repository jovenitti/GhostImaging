#--- Run the script:  
$ python GI_generator.py


#--- Source code:  
The source is coded in python3.


#--- Algorithm:  
It produces several speckle field realizations.  
Every speckle is shadowed with the same object.  
The total intensity (A) is computed for every shadowed field.  
The resulting image is computed  
with the sum of all the NON-SHADOWED images  
weighted on the A numbers.
